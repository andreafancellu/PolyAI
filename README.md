# PolyAI
**PolyAI** explores the use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for polymer classification and quantitative prediction of recycled material content in blends.

## 🎯 Goals
- **Polymer Classification**: automatically identify the polymer type (e.g., PET, PE, PP, PVC, etc.) based on chemical and structural features.  
- **Recycled Content Prediction**: estimate the percentage of recycled material in a polymer sample using chemical and structural parameters.
