# PolyAI
Polymers are large molecular structures composed of repeating subunits (monomers) that form the basis of most plastics and rubbers, each type exhibiting distinct chemical, structural, and mechanical properties.
By applying data-driven Machine Learning techniques, PolyAI seeks to automatically identify polymer types and estimate the percentage of recycled material in polymer blends, supporting the development of more sustainable recycling processes.

## 🎯 Goals
- **Polymer Classification**. Identify the polymer type based on chemical and structural features. 
- **Recycled Content Prediction**: Estimate the percentage of recycled material in a polymer sample using chemical and structural parameters.
